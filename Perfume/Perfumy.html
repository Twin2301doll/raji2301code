		<h1 style="text-align:center;">About-Us</h1>
		<p style="text-align:justify;">A perfume is a very complex composition of top notes, heart notes and base notes.
		Dependent on synthesis method. Generally cheaper, but not necessarily. 
		Synthetic aromatics are not necessarily cheaper than naturals, with some synthetics being more costly than most natural ingredients due to various factors such as the long synthesis routes, low availability of precursor chemicals, and low overall yield. 
		However, due to their low odor threshold, they should be diluted when making a perfume.
